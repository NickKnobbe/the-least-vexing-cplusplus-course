# The Least Vexing C++ Course                                                                                           
This course (under construction) is my effort to teach others and myself about the intricacies of the C++ programming language. It is arranged in byte-size tutorials.
Anyone can benefit from this course, but it is meant for programmers that have some introductory experience in another language and are looking to learn C++.
I welcome you here, and I hope you enjoy!                                                                               

## Navigation                                                                                                           

### Tree Navigation                                                                                                     
The lessons within TLVCC are designed in a hierarchy. They can be navigated by following the path to them in the program,
While running the course, keys in parentheses such as (V) will prepend a menu option to allow for quick navigation.     

### Tag Navigation                                                                                                      
Lessons are given one or more tags to help with studying focused topics. To find lessons associated with a specific     
tag, the tag menu is available in the main menu to allow for filtering by tag instead of navigating the tree.           

## Byte-Sized Lessons
These lessons are meant to impart some sort of key information per lesson in a small lesson format. They aren't geared for complete beginners,
so general knowledge of language-agnostic basics (functions/methods, loops, if/else, integers, floats) is assumed.
A tactic that helped me learn was to read a lesson a couple times per day. At the end of the day, without viewing it, I then quiz myself
and try to remember the entire small lesson.
